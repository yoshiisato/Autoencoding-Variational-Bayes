# Auto-encoding-Variational-Bayes
### Model.py
Implementation of the VAE neural network using pytorch and MNIST database

### Plan:
To train the VAE on MNIST database using cloud GPUs on google colab

### Need to Finish:
1. VAE loss function
2. Training and validation loop
3. Test if the model class is functional
